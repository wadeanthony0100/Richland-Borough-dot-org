        Willow Spring's Park, owned by Tom and Joya Morrissey, has been hosting the
        Annual Polar Bear Plunge for the past 24 years, on New Year's Day.
        <br><br>
        Located on the outskirts of Richland, the Polar Bear Plunge raises money for
        DDS (Developmental and Disability Services) and provides services to children
        and adults with disabilities living in Lebanon County.

        The park welcomes Polar Bears, scuba divers and spectators beginning at 9 AM
        for tailgating and a pre-plunge party with a DJ, food vendors and games.  Polar
        Bears who collect pledges through a "Cold for a Cause" campaign can turn them in
        for a free parking pass.  Parking is $20 on the quarry grounds, due to space
        limitations.  Free parking is available at Dutchway Farmers Market, where a
        shuttle bus runs from 10:30 AM-1 PM.
