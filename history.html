        <h1>A Brief History of Richland</h1>

        <p>
    Among the early settlers in the vicinity were a few Landis families and originally the town was named after them -
    Landisville.  However, there was another Landisville in the adjoining County of Lancaster and this resulted in a
    confusing situation between the two towns bearing the same name.  The name of Richland was selected because of its
    surroundings and the town soon established for itself an independent reputation.
        </p><br>

        <img style="display: inline" src="img/rr_crossing.png" width="600" height="374"  alt=""/>

        <p>
    The Lebanon Valley Branch of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway was built between 1854 and 1857, and during this
    time there were three houses in Richland. The first station was a Baggar Car. Two years after the Railroad was
    completed a permanent Depot was launched, when a grain warehouse was erected by Mr. Stump and Mr. Klopp.  The
    warehouse was destroyed by fire in 1920 at which time it was owned and occupied by C S Kalbach.
        </p><br>

        <p>
    In 1858 a Brick Yard, Saw Mill and a Wood Working Mill were established.  By 1920 they were no longer in operation.
        </p><br>

        <p>
    The first merchant was Edward Landis, who started his enterprise in 1863.  He was followed four years later by
    Mr. Godshalk and Isaac King, of King Bros., and was later succeeded by A.K. Krall.
        </p><br>

        <img src="img/main_st_near_depot.png" width="600" height="374" alt="">


        <p>
    About the same year Edward Noll started a blacksmith shop and coachworks.
        </p><br>

        <p>
    William Noll opened a furniture store and undertaking parlor in 1867.
        </p><br>

        <p>
    In 1868 the Band Hall was erected and Allen Bollinger built a distillery. Two hotels came a few years later.
        </p><br>

        <p>
    In 1871 the first cigar factory was built and operated by Samuel Klopp.  The Hertzler and Kline Cigar factory soon
    followed.
        </p><br>

        <p>
    A tinsmith shop was established by Mr. Stewart in 1872.
        </p><br>

        <p>
    The old school house on North Park Street was replaced by a four room school in 1878 under the supervision of
    Dr. Joseph Zimmerman, who was then one of the Directors.  In 1912 a two room High School addition was built by
    Thomas B Weik, Contractor.  Hauer and Mowrey were the Architects.
        </p><br>

        <img src="img/richland_school.png" width="600" height="374" alt="">

        <p>
    In 1881, ten years after founding his cigar factory, Samuel Klopp pooled his interest with Isaac Kegerries and
    started the Klopp and Kegerries Cigar Factory.  They also did a business in leaf tobacco.  In this plant cigar
    makers were paid 15 cents per hundred; tobacco strippers received from fifteen to twenty five cents per day, and
    the forelady was paid two dollars per week.
        </p><br>

        <p>
    In 1882 A.F. Diehl built a stove, furnace and tinware store.
        </p><br>

        <p>
    G.L. Dry's General Merchandise Store was started in 1887.
        </p><br>

        <p>
    The Moore and Frank Cigar Factory was established in 1890. Four years later the R R Frank and Company Cigar Factory
    was built and operated.  This was succeeded by F.L. Stoltz Cigar Factory.
        </p><br>

        <p>

    unique feature of the Holstein pump, was the fact that it inflated on both the up and down stroke. All other pumps
