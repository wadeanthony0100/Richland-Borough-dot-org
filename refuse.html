            Richland Borough is currently under contract with Lebanon Farms Disposal for the weekly pickup of garbage
            in the borough.  The contract ends 12/31/15.  Richland Borough contracts to one hauler, for the entire
            town, to eliminate garbage trucks, from various companies, collecting garbage in town on different days.
            The property owners are responsible for the yearly contracted amount, whether the home is occupied or vacant.
            Property owners are billed in early October, for the following calendar year, and are given until December 31,
            of the current year, to pay the invoice. After December 31, fees and penalties are imposed.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The Borough contract includes the pickup of up to 8 ea 30 gallon bags or cans, per week, no more than 50 pounds
            per bag or can.  They will take grass clippings – again, in 30 gallon bags or cans, up to 50 pounds per bag
            or can.  They will also take tree limbs, placed in bundles not longer than 4 feet and weighing up to 50 pounds.
            If someone places a bag out that weighs more than 50 pounds, or if more than 8 bags are put out, the refuse
            hauler will not pick them up.

        Because of its size, Richland Borough is not mandated to have recycling in Richland.  However, the citizens
        are free to recycle on their own.  We have provided a link to the Greater Lebanon Refuse Authority for
        information on where to take their recycling in the county, as well as where to take electronics, appliances,
        furniture and other items not included in a normal weekly pickup.
